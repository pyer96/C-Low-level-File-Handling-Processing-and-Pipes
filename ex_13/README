	- 3to5_alphanumeric_SAMPLETXT is a demonstrative file containing
	all password combinantions ranging from 3-letters-long to 
	5-letters-long out of the alphanumeric dictionary (a-zA-Z0-9).
	It was produced by a single worker so that the order of the passwords
	is preserved and smoothly increasing without any interleaving
	that happens when multiple processes write into the same file.
	Since it took quite long to produce the file it is left here with the only
	purpose of being a simple demonstrative reference.

	- This solution is satisfying both the requirements from exercise 13 and
	exercise 14 since it produces both a file containing all the required 
	password combinations (whos filename can be choosen at will) and a file
	(whos filename can't be changed by the user) showing the ranges assigned 
	to each worker so that the user can check how the work has been distributed
