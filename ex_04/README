	In addition to <solution04.c> and the executable <solution04>
	more executables (with respective srcs) are provided in order
	to better handle and manage the outcomes of solution04.

	In particular it is suggested to do the following:

	--------> generate a txt with random floats using:
			./generate_txt_floats 
		(if no argument provided the default txt name is "floats.txt")

	--------> generate a binary float file out of floats.txt using:
			./generate_data_floats floats.txt
		(the output binary file will be created as "data_floats")

	--------> MANAGE the floats written in binary with:
			./read_data_floats <arg1>
		(where arg1 is the binary file you want to read)


	However the Usage of every single executable is explained in the
	header comment of each source file!

	Since the programs are so modular to use, the examples of 
	files converted from txt to binary and viceversa are not provided, it
	would have been confusing.	

	TXT to BINARY:
		./solution04 floats.txt <output> -b

	BINARY to TXT:
		./solution04 dala_floats <output> -t
		

	NOTE: 
	--------> init.sh script provided:
		     |
		     |---> removes all executables except itself
		     |---> compiles all .c files
