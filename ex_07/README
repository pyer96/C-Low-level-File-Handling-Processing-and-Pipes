	This exercise has turned into a little fun project for me so it is 
	slightly different than required since extra features has been added
	with the goal to emulate a professional shell more and more.
	
	To keep it simple, everything has been mantained organized only into
	2 files (shell.c and shell.h) leaving the .c as clean as possible.

	The shell's characteristics are described withing the source file
	shell.c.
	However there are still present some minor issues that up to today I did
	not have the time to fix:
		- When displaying dynamical outputs produced by programs
			like TOP or HTOP after some refreshes the output looses
			unexpectedly its proper formatting
		- Right after failures due to dynamical outputs the commands may be
			not properly received.
